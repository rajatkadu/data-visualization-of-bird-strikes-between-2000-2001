# Data-Visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-Between-2000---2011
This project analyzes bird-aircraft strike data from 2000 to 2011 using Microsoft Power BI. The interactive dashboard allows for exploration of trends and insights to improve aviation safety.

Key Findings
The dashboard explores various aspects of bird-aircraft strikes, including:

-- Total number of strikes (2000-2011)

-- Year-over-year trends

-- Financial impact of bird strikes

-- Most vulnerable flight phases

-- Impact of weather conditions

-- Aircraft damage severity

-- pilot warnings

Using the Dashboard
The dashboard provides interactive visualizations for exploring the data. Users can filter by year, Line charts, Pie charts, Donut and much more for the bettr visualization and insights.


✌️I'm excited to share the completion project. This project involved a deep dive into bird-aircraft strike data from 2000 to 2011, utilizing the powerful data visualization tool, Power BI.

🤔Why Bird-Aircraft Strikes?

Bird strikes pose a significant threat to aviation safety, jeopardizing both passengers and aircraft. This project aimed to analyses historical data to identify trends and inform future mitigation strategies.


💠Key Insights from the Power BI Dashboard:

🔢Total Bird Strikes: We analysed a significant number - 25000 bird strikes - highlighting the prevalence of this threat as 345 species involved in incidents across 1,109 airports in the US.

📉Trend Analysis: The data revealed a concerning upward trend, with the highest number of strikes occurring between 2010-2011.


💲Financial Impact : Bird strikes inflicted a substantial financial burden, with estimated total damages reaching $142 million. The analysis pinpointed the approach phase as the most critical time for strikes, aiding in targeted pilot training and awareness.


🌀Weather & Aircraft Resilience: Interestingly, most incidents occurred during clear skies, suggesting the need for mitigation strategies beyond just bad weather conditions. Fortunately, the data showed that around 90% of strikes caused minimal or no damage to the aircraft, showcasing their robust design.


👨‍✈️Pilot Warning - A Call to Action: A concerning finding was that pilots were not warned in a significant portion of the incidents. This highlights the importance of improved bird hazard detection systems.
